this is an implementation of BFS algorithm on a game called 14-puzzle. 14-puzzle is a more advanced and
harder version of 9-puzzle. the goal is to reach the below state :

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 0 0

while the initial state is different. we can only replace numbers other than zero with zeros.
