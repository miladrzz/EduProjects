# EduProjects
my educational projects
these 3 projects are just some of the projects which I developed during my bachelor's programme.
BFS and A* algorithms are implemented on a puzzle called 14-puzzle. these 2 projects were developed for AI course.
I also have developed a basic website (which is just a demo and ran on apache) for selling battle.net products.
this website is my first experience with web-developing, PHP laravel and MVC model.
